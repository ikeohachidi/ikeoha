      <p>
        I’m a software developer and a writer. I’m still working hard on the writing part.<br>
        I do fullstack web development mainly with Vuejs on the frontend and Golang on the backend. I’ve written some open source projects mostly with ideas mostly coming from my own problems I’m trying to solve or did solve and now want to share with others.

        I can be found on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ikeohachidi" target="_blank">@ikeoha_chidi</a> on Github <a href="https://github.com/ikeohachidi" target="_blank">@ikeohachidi</a>. Generally speaking if i’m going to be on any social platform that’ll be my username. That’s if it’s not an imposter. Feel free to reach out.
